         <p class="bold_p">
             The Geekwise Academy Cohort program has been developed to bridge the gap between Geekwise Academy course students and their ability to move into roles as developers in the local technology industry.
         </p>
         <p class="bold_p">
            The Cohort consists of two phases. The first is a two week internship for the 20 individuals that were invited to the Cohort program. This phase includes QA and testing of the invitees skill set. In phase two, 8 of the 20 Invitees will be chosen to participate in a 24 week internship program. Phase two consists of three assignments each eight weeks in length. During this time the Cohorts will complete work for clients through projects of increased difficulty. Also, Cohort participants will be required to co-teach Geekwise Academy classes. They will work with the Cohort Director and Bethany Mily to prepare for this opportunity.

               When I first heard about the Cohort Program, I thought it would be a great opportunity to really dig deep into web development. I am grateful for the opportunity to work on projects early in my career that I would not have got on my own. I'm looking forward to seeing what I can learn and what the program has in store for me.

                   When I was invited to the Cohort, I saw it as an opportunity to become the developer I want to be. I really enjoy working on projects that will increase my level of knowledge and also make the clients proud of the end result.
